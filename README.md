# FPS-Game-built-on-Unity
A first person shooter developed on Unity Engine. The premise of the game is to shoot and kill as many enemies as possible, which will spawn randomly in the arena. Few game objects are optimized using Blender. 

All Scripts are coded in C#.

Scripts are in: HAZESHOCK/Assets/Scripts

The game is fully playable yet still, under development at the moment!

Note: This project takes currently about 2.4 gb of space.
